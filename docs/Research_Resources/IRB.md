# Resources and Links for Writing an IRB Protocol 

Beginning an IRB protocol can feel daunting, but luckily the UMN IRB has a wealth of resources and templates to make the process simpler. Some key links are listed below: 
- A collection of UMN [IRB Templates](https://research.umn.edu/units/irb/toolkit-library/templates-forms) to help you get started on whichever document you need to prepare
- **Creating a new study?** [This new study page](https://research.umn.edu/units/irb/how-submit/new-study) has a number of useful tips for creating a protocol, submitting through ETHOS, using template boilerplate text, and a new study checklist to follow
- The IRB [Investigator Manual](https://research.umn.edu/sites/research.umn.edu/files/hrp-103_-_investigator_manual_google_doc.pdf), which will answer specific questions regarding research practices, review, consenting, advertising, PHI, etc. 
- The [UMN IRB overview](https://research.umn.edu/units/irb/about-us/overview) to provide a better overview of the University of Minnesota's specific IRB structure and practices (boards vary between institutions and by state--it is important to be informed about the IRB at your current institution)
- FAQs and important links on [starting a new study](https://research.umn.edu/units/irb/how-submit/new-study). 
- A guide for developing [REDCap Electronic Consent Forms](https://ctsi.umn.edu/news/how-use-redcap-electronic-consent). These guidelines must be followed EXACTLY in order to receive IRB approval and to conduct your study. 
- You can learn more about IRB statistics, turnaround, and timing on [this page](https://research.umn.edu/units/irb/about-us/irb-performance-metrics)
- The UMN IRB uses the platform **[ETHOS](https://research.umn.edu/units/irb/ethos/ethos-log) for IRB submission**

Writing a protocol and reading guidelines should be taken with the same gravity as any legal document. You will be bound to the practices that you state in your protocol, so it is very important to: 
1. Read and follow guidelines precisely in order to expedite your protocol's approval and reduce how many times you must resubmit it for review 
2. Make sure that what you outline in your protocol is feasible and applicable to every participant (You can build in conditional clauses in your consent form and in your protocol to cover parts of the protocol that may apply to some, but not all, participants) 
3. Make sure you are following the correct guidelines for the type of experiment you plan to conduct (this will depend on your participant population and the type of data you are collecting/analyzing; further information available on the IRB website)
4. Ask questions! You can always [request a consultation with the UMN IRB](https://research.umn.edu/units/irb/how-submit/new-study)
5. Look at existing IRB protocols in the lab to get a sense of the research we do and how others have drafted protocols in the past

## Accessing DANCE Lab IRBs 

Previous IRB protocols can be found in the DANCE_IRB section of the [DANCE Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16dbfKNJ_zwDbcHj4A_FXfwfrQlp-24_w?ths=true). It is very important to reference language and protocol numbers of already-approved IRB protocols when beginning a new one. Protocols are organized by name/number and further by submission type (e.g., initial submission, clarification, modification). All official IRB correspondence and stamped documents are also stored in these folders.
