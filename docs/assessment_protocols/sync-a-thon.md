# Sync-a-Thon Hyperscanning Protocol

This study is meant to conduct a longitudinal like study of Neural Synchrony using fNIRS in a Hyperscanning Dyad. We're primarily using RAs as participants for the time being. 

### Pre-Visit Setup

Put two pre-populated caps and two fNIRS devices in the testing room. 

#### Control room
Put Event Key Flow Sheet Sheet on the desk.
Check the placement of TP-LINK. Ensure it is plugged into the outlet under the desk, near the audio system.
Place fNIRS Laptop 1 on the desk and connect it to the charger, link the laptop to the Pearl System using HDMI cable on the desk.
Turn on and open the pearl/AV system, make sure that two video camera and the laptop can be seen on the screen. Adjust the two cameras so that we can see the participants’ faces clearly and "flatly" as possible. 

### Start video recording

Once the participants enter the room, start the video recording. Even if the procedure hasn't started yet, we can always cut out the first part of the recording.

### Pre-task Survey

Have the participants use the bathroom if needed then position them in the testing room. Once seated, have them take the pre-task survey. While they are taking the pre-task survey, set up the cameras on their faces straight on and the video screen. 
If this is the participant's first time, measure their heads for cap fitting and set up the fNIRS caps while they complete the pre task survey.
Link to the pre task study is (HERE)[].

### fNIRS set up & Calibration.

Once the participants are done with the pre task survey, place caps on participants head and calibrate with the hyperscanning app. 
Instruction: **“We will begin with a calibration to check signal quality. Please sit comfortably with your feet flat on the floor and your hands resting in a a relaxed position"**
Take a screenshot of the calibration page of BOTH participants when the calibration is finished. Save the screenshot as "PreTaskSurvey_DATE"

### Open Psychopy

The psychoPy program sometimes freaks out if the Aurora/Hyperscanning apps are not opened first.

### Start fNIRS Hyperscan recording

If everything else is ready to go, hit record and start the PsychoPy program!

### Resting Baseline (5 minutes)

Instruction: **“Now we’re going to record a five-minute baseline. Please sit s1ll, relax, and try not to talk or move during this 1me. Just sit comfortably and rest”**

WIP: (resting state, 5 minutes closed eyes, 5 minutes "calming videos")
 
### Video-Game Session 1 (15 minutes)

Instruction: **“Now it’s time to start gaming! Please open switch, and move to [World X], [Level X].”**
[Wait until participants have moved to the correct world and level.]
**“When you are ready, you can start playing.”**
Hit PsychoPy marker once the video game avatars start moving. 

*Day 1: Level 2-2
*Day 2: Level 3-2
*Day 3: Level 4-2
*Day 4: New level that has not been unlocked
*Repeat cycle

### Watch gaming videos Session (15 minutes)

Instruction: **“Now you will watch video showing how other people play the same level in the game”**
Setup laptop with YouTube playlist in the testing room in front of the monitor. Head back to the observation room and start recording when they click the play button. 
**“We’ll start in 3, 2, 1… start.”**
Once the timer in PsychoPy is up, have them stop the video. Go and retrieve the laptop and make sure they are set up for the next gaming section. 

### Video-Game Session 2 (15 minutes)

Instruction: **“We’re going to play again. Please open the Switch and move to [World X], [Level X].”**
[Wait until participants have moved to the correct world and level.]
**“When you are ready, you can start playing.”**
Click the spacebar in PsychoPy once the video game avatars start moving. 

### Post-Task Conversation (5 minutes)

Instruction: **“Okay it’s time to stop playing video game. I'll come in to adjust your chairs so you are facing each other"**
Enter the testing room and lift up the chairs with the NIRs boxes and shuffle the participants around the table to these points.

The goal is to get a camera on each participant's face as flat as possible. 
**"Now you have five minutes to discuss about the game you just played. If you run out of things to discuss, you can discuss what happened in your daily life”**

### Post-task Calibration & Removal of Caps

Instruction: **“Okay it’s 1me to stop talking. Now we are going to do another calibration to check the signal quality. Make sure that your feet are on the ground and your hands are in relaxing positions.”**
Calibrate both participants with the Hyperscanning app and take another screenshot labeled PostTaskCalibration_DATE. Make sure you are capturing both participants!
Once calibrated, go in, set up the manikin heads on the table, and take off the caps. Have the participants take the post-task survey on their phones. 

Grab fNIRS data& the PsychoPy timing markers. from the laptop & copy to USB.
fNIRS data folder: Documents/NIRx/Data/[Date]/
Psychopy timing marker: Documents/Hyperscanning Timer Psychopy/LSL/Data/

### Post-task Survey

Link to the study is (HERE)[]. Once participants have completed the post task survey, they should check in with the Study RAs and then they are free to go. 

### Stop video recording & save video data to USB

In video recording system. *ONLY plug in the USB after you stop the video recording, and DO NOT close the video recording system until the video is fully uploaded to USB (it will appear as “no usb” on the screen).

### Upload all the data

Both video and fNIRS data to box drive and the external hard drive. 
 
Box folder: DANCE Lab/DANCE Lab Projects/Sync-A-Thon/Data/INSERT-DATE
External hard drive: On the desk with the Mac in the lab manager's office. It's has a bright orange bumper around it.
