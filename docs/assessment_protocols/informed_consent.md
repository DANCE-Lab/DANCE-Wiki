# Collecting Informed Consent During Data Collection

### **Watch an example of the DANCE consent process [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWnQt_5I-gY)**

### **IRB approved documents (including Informed Consent Forms, Child Assent Forms, screening scripts, etc.) can be found in the [DANCE Lab IRB Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19pH3p4Us1Sa6EdYonSyicn8ZgV9vc-6R?ths=true)**

Collecting informed consent is the most important part of the data collection process. No study measures can be carried out before the study has been clearly explained to your participant and they have signed the consent form, indicating that they are willing to participate in study procedures. 

Please make sure you have finished all required HIPAA and CITI trainings before learning to consent participants. When designing consent forms, you are encouraged to reference the [wiki IRB resources page](https://dance-lab.github.io/DANCE-Wiki/docs/Research_Resources/IRB/). Before practicing the consent process with friends and lab mates, makes sure to carefully read through the form and highlight main talking points.
