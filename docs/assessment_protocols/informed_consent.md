# Collecting Informed Consent During Data Collection

## [Informed consent rubric here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qS2ftBenyLADRQ-1N1T3oHagEMjXdrMHWvd7PfT-EwU/edit?tab=t.0)

### **Watch an example of the DANCE consent process [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWnQt_5I-gY)**

### **IRB approved documents (including Informed Consent Forms, Child Assent Forms, screening scripts, etc.) can be found in the [DANCE Lab IRB Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19pH3p4Us1Sa6EdYonSyicn8ZgV9vc-6R?ths=true)**

Collecting informed consent is the most important part of the data collection process. No study measures can be carried out before the study has been clearly explained to your participant and they have signed the consent form, indicating that they are willing to participate in study procedures. 

Please make sure you have finished all required HIPAA and CITI trainings before learning to consent participants. When designing consent forms, you are encouraged to reference the [wiki IRB resources page](https://dance-lab.github.io/DANCE-Wiki/docs/Research_Resources/IRB/). Before practicing the consent process with friends and lab mates, makes sure to carefully read through the form and highlight main talking points. 

## How do I collect informed consent? 

1. Begin building rapport with your participant. Introduce yourself (name/position/lab) and try to make a little bit of small talk to help the participant feel comfortable and establish lines of open communication at the beginning of the study. 

2. Begin the consent process by giving a brief overview of what the study involves. Make sure to highlight A. how research differs from clinical/diagnostic procedures; B. What the lab investigates; C. Who the participant can reach out to with questions or concerns; D. emphasize that the study is entirely voluntary and that the participant can withdraw from the study at any time without penalty

3. Walk through the form section by section, paraphrasing its contents. You should have the contents of the form mostly memorized and should not be reading directly from the form unless the participant asks for additonal details. Pause often to ask whether the participant has any questions.

4. Once all of the participant's questions have been answered, you may ask them to sign the form. Make sure to sign your own name as the individual collecting informed consent. 

## How do I prepare to collect informed consent?

1. Practice often with a friend! The best way to get comfortable with the material and the consent process is to practice with another person. 

2. Highlight the most important sections in a paper copy of the consent form. This will help you know what to study and what to memorize for the consent process. 

3. Review the example consent video at the top of this page before practicing
