# How to Generate a NIH Toolbox Task Report for Parents

Parents of participants in our studies utilizing the NIH Toolbox will be given the opportunity to request a score report of their child's performance on the tasks they completed. This report can be generated by finding the participant's corresponding ID number in the NIH toolbox app on the lab ipad. You will be able to generate a reader-friendly pdf that will list the child's scores and provide a visual figure that shows how the child performed compared to other children of the same age. 

However, it is important that parents understand that these are not diagnostic assessments and that the score reports are not indicative of their children's intelligence or abilities--it is only a piece of descriptive information. To help parents better understand how to read their score reports, we will send the pdfs to parents along with an email (script below) that will help parents interpret their child's performance.

Dear **[Parent Name, or Parent of Child Name]**,

The D.A.N.C.E. Lab at the University of Minnesota would like to thank you for participating in our research study at **[data collection location]**. Your time and efforts were very much appreciated, and we are grateful for your contribution to our research. Attached to this email you will find your child’s score report from the two iPad tasks that were completed for our study. These tasks were the Dimensional Card Sort task and the Picture Vocabulary task. In the report, you will see your child’s raw score on the task and a percentile score, which is how your child’s score compares to the scores of other participants of the same age. However, this test is not necessarily indicative of your child’s ability, as these measures do not capture each child’s unique abilities and each child develops in their own way. 

These scores are not diagnostic in any way, and are not a measure of your child’s intelligence or a benchmark of their development. The lab also recognizes that participating in an experiment can be exciting, distracting, or even nerve wracking for children at times, which can impact their attention and their scores on these tasks. On the experiment day, we administered the following iPad tasks to your child: 

The Picture Vocabulary Task: this task asks your child to choose which picture (out of four presented pictures) best represents a word that they hear. Some words are easy, and some words are very challenging. This task tells us a little bit about their vocabulary and language skills.

The Dimensional Card Sort Task: this task is a type of matching game, and asks your child to match a new picture with a reference image based on either shape or color. This task tells us a little bit about their thinking flexibility and demonstrates how they switch between types of tasks (color versus shape).

Your child’s score report is attached to this email. 

Thank you again for your participation!

Sincerely,

DANCE Lab Research Team
