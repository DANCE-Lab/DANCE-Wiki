# How to Manage the DANCE Lab 

These pages outline and provide instructions for the day-to-day tasks required to manage the DANCE Lab. 

### General Tasks

- Keeping the wiki up to date and maintianing lab documentation
- Lab purchasing 
- IRB writing and maintenance 
- Running and maintaining trainings for undergraduate RAs (fNRIS training, NIH toolbox administration training, etc.)
- Undergraduate RA recruitment and teaching CPSY4994
- Data entry, cleaning, and curation
- Lab scheduling 
- Password  and subscription maintenance
- Organizing and facilitating data collection for lab experiments (scheduling, recruitment, data collection)

This page will orient you and provide some basic instructions to guide you through each of these tasks!

## Documentation

Documentation is the most important thing in the lab! Documenting how to complete different tasks and creating training guides will hugely reduce how much other individuals in the lab depend on you and create long-term stability in the DANCE lab. This wiki is the hub of all lab information and it is absolutely imperative that it stays up to date and grows with the lab. All lab members should be able to contribute to the pages on this wiki, but as the lab manager you will be contributing the bulk of information and curating these pages. You will need to use GitHub in order to contribute to these pages. 

1. If you haven't already, create a GitHub account! Ask one of the senior lab members to add you to the DANCE-WIKI repository in an 'admin' role. It is important to have an admin role and to not just be a member with 'write' privileges.

2. Download Visual Studio Code. You can find instructions on the [VSC website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Open VS Code and download a few useful extensions to help with editing, including `GitHub Codespaces` and `GitHub Copilot`. You will need to enter your GitHub login credentials into VSCode to facilitate a successful connection.

3. Follow instructions on the wiki [github instructions page](https://dance-lab.github.io/DANCE-Wiki/docs/Lab_Basics/github/) to get the DANCE-Wiki respository connected to your computer. Note that as an admin member, you will not have to submit pull requests. You may commit updates directly to the repository and you will be responsible for approving and reviewing pull requests that other contributors suggest. 

4. Write everything down! The more comprehensive the wiki is, the better the lab will run, so create SOPs liberally and encourage other members of the lab to contribute. 

## Lab Purchasing

As lab manager, you will be responsible for buying anything the lab needs to run and keep data collection going smoothly. This includes maintaining our NIRx supplies inventory, buying prizes for kids who participate in studies, maintaining giftcards (or whatever type of compensation being used for participating families) and any hardware or software needed for the lab. 

1. NIRx supplies is maintained through the [NIRx site](https://nirx.net/). The lab communicates frequently with NIRx and has an account with their support site (login credentials can be found in the [lab manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xI9PL6pvZ1jMR5U3Ry8z02KZRqNvFsKIBbI4vnMuDKY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.74tq45l90tk1)). Don't be shy to reach out if you need replacement parts, instructions, troubleshooting, or even documents to support the approval of an IRB protocol. 

2. General purchases can be completed through your [MyU page](https://login.umn.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Redirect/SSO?execution=e1s2). Navigate to the "purchasing" tab on the left and click on the big button that says "Shop UMarket". 

3. Select the necessary items from university suppliers. The university prefers that we order from all other suppliers before ordering from Amazon (although it is sometimes necessary for specific items)

4. When you’re done, click on the shopping cart icon and click “check out”

5. Now click the button “Assign Cart” and search for Eric Hart’s name. Assign the cart to Eric

6. Write a summary of everything you have purchased and why. Include the name of the lab (you are purchasing for “DANCE Lab”). Include the chart string you will be charging for the purchases (if you are unsure of what this is, please consult Ka)

7. You have now purchased something! Eric will receive an email and will approve the purchases. You will pick up the packages when they arrive in the Campbell Hall Mail Room 

If you have any questions or concerns, reach out to Eric Hart (hartx036@umn.edu)

## IRB Writing and Maintenance

Writing and maintaining IRB protocols is an important part of keeping the lab working well. UMN-IRB specific guidelines and documents can be found on the wiki's [IRB Resources](https://dance-lab.github.io/DANCE-Wiki/docs/Research_Resources/IRB/) page. IRB documents and protocol drafts are stored in the lab google drive, and can be found in the [IRB folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19pH3p4Us1Sa6EdYonSyicn8ZgV9vc-6R?ths=true). Create a new folder for each project, and within that folder create a folder for each subsequent modification to keep documents organized. If you are unsure of how to write an IRB protocol or have concerns, you are welcome to reach out to the IRB and to schedule a meeting to get your questions answered. You can also reference old protocols for example language and structure.

[Ethos](https://ethos.umn.edu/Ethos/sd/Rooms/DisplayPages/LayoutInitial?Container=com.webridge.entity.Entity[OID[5C3E6DF4AA49DF408616C9B82E714D46]]) is the UMN IRB website. 

## Training RAs

A big part of this job is training RAs on best data collection practices! You can spread out trainings across weekly RA meetings and build them into your CPSY4994 class. The lab manager is responsible for teaching this class every semester. You can find old syllabi, teaching materials, and evaluation rubrics in our [DANCE google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18WqHDMRH143UAbpw2R_BTdHHQNxpJO3h?ths=true). There are also lots of useful resources and instructions under the [RA Resources](https://dance-lab.github.io/DANCE-Wiki/docs/undergrad_ras/ra_resources/) tab of this wiki. There is also a [canvas course](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/502637) for CPSY4994 which can be edited and updated for each new semester to help you and the RAs stay organized. In the past, RA semesters have culminated in an ICD-wide poster symposium where undergrads present original research projects and proposals, but the content and structure of CPSY4994 is ultimately up to you. The sections below outline the shape and structure of previous training materials that have been created for the lab. 

### fNIRS Training

The lab has worked hard to develop a training program for fNIRS. It is a collection of SOPs and videos (made in-lab and pulled from the NIRx website)

### Collecting Informed Consent

### NIH Toolbox Administration
