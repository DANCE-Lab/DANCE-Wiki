# How to Manage the DANCE Lab 

These pages outline and provide instructions for the day-to-day tasks required to manage the DANCE Lab. 

### General Tasks

- Keeping the wiki up to date and maintianing lab documentation
- Lab purchasing 
- IRB writing and maintenance 
- Running and maintaining trainings for undergraduate RAs (fNRIS training, NIH toolbox administration training, etc.)
- Undergraduate RA recruitment and teaching CPSY4994
- Data entry, cleaning, and curation
- Lab scheduling 
- Password  and subscription maintenance
- Organizing and facilitating data collection for lab experiments (scheduling, recruitment, data collection)

This page will orient you and provide some basic instructions to guide you through each of these tasks!

## Documentation

Documentation is the most important thing in the lab! Documenting how to complete different tasks and creating training guides will hugely reduce how much other individuals in the lab depend on you and create long-term stability in the DANCE lab. This wiki is the hub of all lab information and it is absolutely imperative that it stays up to date and grows with the lab. All lab members should be able to contribute to the pages on this wiki, but as the lab manager you will be contributing the bulk of information and curating these pages. You will need to use GitHub in order to contribute to these pages. 

1. If you haven't already, create a GitHub account! Ask one of the senior lab members to add you to the DANCE-WIKI repository in an 'admin' role. It is important to have an admin role and to not just be a member with 'write' privileges.

2. Download Visual Studio Code. You can find instructions on the [VSC website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Open VS Code and download a few useful extensions to help with editing, including `GitHub Codespaces` and `GitHub Copilot`. You will need to enter your GitHub login credentials into VSCode to facilitate a successful connection.

3. Follow instructions on the wiki [github instructions page](https://dance-lab.github.io/DANCE-Wiki/docs/Lab_Basics/github/) to get the DANCE-Wiki respository connected to your computer. Note that as an admin member, you will not have to submit pull requests. You may commit updates directly to the repository and you will be responsible for approving and reviewing pull requests that other contributors suggest. 

4. Write everything down! The more comprehensive the wiki is, the better the lab will run, so create SOPs liberally and encourage other members of the lab to contribute. 

## Lab Purchasing

As lab manager, you will be responsible for buying anything the lab needs to run and keep data collection going smoothly. This includes maintaining our NIRx supplies inventory, buying prizes for kids who participate in studies, maintaining giftcards (or whatever type of compensation being used for participating families) and any hardware or software needed for the lab. 

1. NIRx supplies is maintained through the [NIRx site](https://nirx.net/). The lab communicates frequently with NIRx and has an account with their support site (login credentials can be found in the [lab manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xI9PL6pvZ1jMR5U3Ry8z02KZRqNvFsKIBbI4vnMuDKY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.74tq45l90tk1)). Don't be shy to reach out if you need replacement parts, instructions, troubleshooting, or even documents to support the approval of an IRB protocol. Reach out to NIRx and ask for a quote for any NIRx equipment supplies needed. 

2. General purchases can be completed through your [MyU page](https://login.umn.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Redirect/SSO?execution=e1s2). Navigate to the "purchasing" tab on the left and click on the big button that says "Shop UMarket". 

3. Select the necessary items from university suppliers. The university prefers that we order from all other suppliers before ordering from Amazon (although it is sometimes necessary for specific items)

4. When you’re done, click on the shopping cart icon and click “check out”

5. Now click the button “Assign Cart” and search for Eric Hart’s name. Assign the cart to Eric

6. Write a summary of everything you have purchased and why. Include the name of the lab (you are purchasing for “DANCE Lab”). Include the chart string you will be charging for the purchases (if you are unsure of what this is, please consult Ka)

7. You have now purchased something! Eric will receive an email and will approve the purchases. You will pick up the packages when they arrive in the Campbell Hall Mail Room 

If you have any questions or concerns, reach out to Eric Hart (hartx036@umn.edu)

## IRB Writing and Maintenance

Writing and maintaining IRB protocols is an important part of keeping the lab working well. UMN-IRB specific guidelines and documents can be found on the wiki's [IRB Resources](https://dance-lab.github.io/DANCE-Wiki/docs/Research_Resources/IRB/) page. IRB documents and protocol drafts are stored in the lab google drive, and can be found in the [IRB folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19pH3p4Us1Sa6EdYonSyicn8ZgV9vc-6R?ths=true). Create a new folder for each project, and within that folder create a folder for each subsequent modification to keep documents organized. If you are unsure of how to write an IRB protocol or have concerns, you are welcome to reach out to the IRB and to schedule a meeting to get your questions answered. You can also reference old protocols for example language and structure.

[Ethos](https://ethos.umn.edu/Ethos/sd/Rooms/DisplayPages/LayoutInitial?Container=com.webridge.entity.Entity[OID[5C3E6DF4AA49DF408616C9B82E714D46]]) is the UMN IRB website. 

One important thing to remember: **keep personnel up to date on IRBs!** All RAs trained in data collection MUST be added to the IRB protocol. All RAs MUST complete required HIPAA and CITI trainings before they can be added to the protocol.

## Training RAs

A big part of this job is training RAs on best data collection practices! You can spread out trainings across weekly RA meetings and build them into your CPSY4994 class. The lab manager is responsible for teaching this class every semester. You can find old syllabi, teaching materials, and evaluation rubrics in our [DANCE google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18WqHDMRH143UAbpw2R_BTdHHQNxpJO3h?ths=true). There are also lots of useful resources and instructions under the [RA Resources](https://dance-lab.github.io/DANCE-Wiki/docs/undergrad_ras/ra_resources/) tab of this wiki. There is also a [canvas course](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/502637) for CPSY4994 which can be edited and updated for each new semester to help you and the RAs stay organized. In the past, RA semesters have culminated in an ICD-wide poster symposium where undergrads present original research projects and proposals, but the content and structure of CPSY4994 is ultimately up to you. The sections below outline the shape and structure of previous training materials that have been created for the lab. 

### fNIRS Training

The lab has worked hard to develop a training program for fNIRS. It is a collection of SOPs and videos (made in-lab and pulled from the NIRx website) are linked in the [fNIRS training canvas course](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/399112), stored in the [google drive SOPs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bJeYDBXjKn9TenocR24nVK_wIFZWcl4K?ths=true), and are listed in chronological order in the [fNIRS SOPs](https://dance-lab.github.io/DANCE-Wiki/docs/fnirs_protocols/fnirs_protocols/) section of this wiki. These resources include a video of the 2025 DANCE Lab winter fNIRS bootcamp and some additional DANCE Lab-specific fNRIS videos including a tour of the DANCE lab data collection rooms and equipment.

Please makes sure that you keep the fNIRS pages up to date!

### Collecting Informed Consent

Collecting informed consent is a very important part of data collection! Consent documents are stored inside the [DANCE IRB Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19pH3p4Us1Sa6EdYonSyicn8ZgV9vc-6R?ths=true). If you are unsure of how to collect consent, you can refer to the video and instructions posted to the [consent tab of this wiki](https://dance-lab.github.io/DANCE-Wiki/docs/assessment_protocols/informed_consent/). Please update the page as needed. 

### NIH Toolbox and Administration

The NIH toolbox is easy to administer! However, there are few important things you should know.
1. **The subscription automatically renews every year on October 22nd**. It also costs $599.99/year. If you DO NOT want to renew this, you must log into the apple account of the ICD DANCE Lab (login info can be found in the [DANCE manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xI9PL6pvZ1jMR5U3Ry8z02KZRqNvFsKIBbI4vnMuDKY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.74tq45l90tk1)). 
2. You also must email a receipt of the purchase to Eric Hart when it is renewed.
3. The app lives on the DANCE ipad. You can access it with the codes specified in the DANCE lab manual. There are many videos online that can teach you how to administer it. 
4. Data should be exported frequently from the ipad during periods of data collection. NO PHI or IDENTIFIERS should be entered into the NIH toolbox app. Participants should be identified exclusively by their participant ID number. Exported data can be stored in BOX.
5. Occasionally, the lab will provide NIH toolbox feedback to interested parents. Guidance for writing these emails and providing feedback can be found in the DANCE drive and on the [NIH toolbox tab of the wiki](https://dance-lab.github.io/DANCE-Wiki/docs/assessment_protocols/nihtb_report/).

### Data Wrangling

The lab has a repository of scripts and tutorials for data wrangling that should be used and shared! The DANCE github repository [RA Scripts](https://github.com/DANCE-Lab/RA_scripts) contains practice Jupyter notebooks to help RAs learn python, if interested, and some example data wranlging scripts used to analyze data from the state fair. A large repository of data wrangling and coding resources can also be found on the [Data Wrangling](https://dance-lab.github.io/DANCE-Wiki/docs/undergrad_ras/data_wrangling/) wiki tab.

### Recruiting RAs

It is important to actively recruit new RAs to the lab! We have a policy that RAs must commit at least 2 semesters for a minimum of 5 credits total (across both semesters) to the lab. RAs are welcome to stay beyond that with credit and volunteer flexibility. There are many places where you can recruit RAs. It is important to communicate about this and stay in contact with Meghan Allen Eliason (alle0335@umn.edu), who oversees CPSY4994. Also note that there is a Lab Manager Network (reach out to Emmy [higgs046@umn.edu] and Annie [colom087@umn.edu] for more information) that can help you learn more about being a lab manager and how to recruit RAs and participants. We have recruited through...
- Undergraduate Research Fair (annual)
- Posters around Campbell Hall
- Ka inquiring about interested students in his classes

Try to get all new RAs recruited at LEAST 1 week before semester begins. Later causes far more difficulty.


## The UMN Department Account

This is our **icddancelab@umn.edu** account. **It must be refreshed each year in December or it will be deleted.** It's validity can also only be extended for a maximum of 365 days so it must be updated each year. You can manage this department account [here](http://my-account.umn.edu/). The contact person must be updated each year and should be someone affiliated with the department and not an undergraduate student.

It is very important that you check this account frequently, as sometimes it receives important correspondence. It is also useful for posting to the google drive and controlling sharing privileges. Please always make sure to update any passwords or information you may change in the lab manual.


## Lab Scheduling

You will be in charge of organizing lab scheduling, including lab meetings, Ka's biweekly meetings, lab social events, and any other lab-wide or RA-wide lab-related event. There are many tools you can use including When2Meet, Doodle polls, or even REDCap/Qualtrics, but my preferred method was [Schej](https://schej.it/). Make sure to stay on top of scheduling and to send polls far in advance. I also maintained a lab-wide calendar where I posted all lab-relevant events. These events can be edited to include zoom links for remote participants.

## Keeping the Listserv up to date

There is a google group listserv that has the emails of all DANCE lab members. It is important to keep this listserv up to date, and it should be updated at the very least at the beginning of each semestser. The group can be edited [here](https://groups.google.com/a/umn.edu/g/dancelab_members/members?pli=1).
