## Documentation

Documentation is the most important thing in the lab! Documenting how to complete different tasks and creating training guides will hugely reduce how much other individuals in the lab depend on you and create long-term stability in the DANCE lab. This wiki is the hub of all lab information and it is absolutely imperative that it stays up to date and grows with the lab. All lab members should be able to contribute to the pages on this wiki, but as the lab manager you will be contributing the bulk of information and curating these pages. You will need to use GitHub in order to contribute to these pages. 

1. If you haven't already, create a GitHub account! Ask one of the senior lab members to add you to the DANCE-WIKI repository in an 'admin' role. It is important to have an admin role and to not just be a member with 'write' privileges.

2. Download Visual Studio Code. You can find instructions on the [VSC website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Open VS Code and download a few useful extensions to help with editing, including `GitHub Codespaces` and `GitHub Copilot`. You will need to enter your GitHub login credentials into VSCode to facilitate a successful connection.

3. Follow instructions on the wiki [github instructions page](https://dance-lab.github.io/DANCE-Wiki/docs/Lab_Basics/github/) to get the DANCE-Wiki respository connected to your computer. Note that as an admin member, you will not have to submit pull requests. You may commit updates directly to the repository and you will be responsible for approving and reviewing pull requests that other contributors suggest.
