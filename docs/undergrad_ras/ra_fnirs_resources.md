# RA fNIRS Training FAQs and Resources

### *“I’m a RA who is starting fNIRS training…so what exactly is fNIRS?”*

This video is a short and sweet explanation of what fNIRS measures and why this type of brain activity measurement is used. You will understand the basics of the fNIRS equipment by the end of the video. After watching this video, you should also be able to explain what fNIRS is to anyone outside of the psychology field!

### *"I'm an RA who is starting fNIRS training, but how will I be evaluated?"*

You will be evaluated on your ability to carry out a data collection protocol from start to finish! Once you have completed your training, which includes a combination of in-person practical training sessions, self-led training sessions, and completion of the DANCE fNIRS canvas course, you will complete a ~30 minute practical with the lab manager where you will demonstrate your ability to collect fNIRS data. You will be evaluated based upon a rubric (see below) and will be expected to complete all of the steps laid out in these SOP pages!

### *“I’m a RA who needs to fill some extra hours this week. I’d also like to learn some of the more in-depth details about why we use fNIRS and how the equipment works.”*

This video will provide you with an overview of what fNIRS equipment does and how it can be used in our lab. The video will cover how the NIRS equipment collects data, why this method of collection is special, how to collect a good signal, and how this type of data collection is advantageous to our psychology research. This video will go in-depth about things that you do NOT need to know for basic fNIRS set up and data collection we do in the lab. However, understanding how these materials function can provide you with additional background knowledge on the equipment used in our lab.

### *“I’ve been practicing using the fNIRS caps and notice it’s harder to get a good signal on some people. Why?”* 

Since fNIRS equipment relies on infrared light penetrating the scalp, collecting a good signal on people of color, with curly hair, or with thick hair, can be difficult. Due to the difficulty collecting data on these populations, it excludes people from participating in fNIRS research. This journal discusses what challenges research teams have faced collecting representative samples, and proposes solutions for creating more inclusive research practices.

### *“I’m an RA that needs more hours this week! I have been practicing fNIRS and would like some supplemental reading to fill some hours this week.”*

This article will walk you through the entire history of fNIRS dating back to the first discovery of infrared light detecting brain activity.  This type of research has been practiced for less than 50 years, but there have been massive leaps in the quality and quantity of data collection possible with this type of equipment.
