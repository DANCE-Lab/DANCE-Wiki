Hi! **Pollyanna** here!
## fNIRS Data Collection to Go: A Draft
### This is the beginning of a list of items we have to pack when taking the fNIRS equipment to another location

- Different sizes of caps (Caucasian and Asian)
- Mannequin heads
- Shower caps
- Measure tapes
- Skin-safe markers
- fNIRS run sheets
- Source bundles (red)
- Detector bundles (blue)
- Appropriate springs (0 - 3)
  - Take sufficient level 3 springs to cover the entire head - necessary when the optodes reading is not optimal
- Sufficient number of cable trees - two per cap
- Couplers
- Velcro straps - clips
- Cleaning materials:
  - Fabric disinfectant spray
  - Alcohol cleansing wipes
- Dongle
- fNIRS straps (to hold the cap by the shoulders)
- Backpacks
- Wand to separate hair (I forgot the name)
- *To be continued...*
- *... and improved.*
