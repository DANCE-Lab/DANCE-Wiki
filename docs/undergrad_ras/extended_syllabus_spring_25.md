## Introduction to the D.A.N.C.E Lab
The Development, Affective Neuroscience, Culture, and Environment Lab studies brain and emotion regulation development, cultural factors that shape regulation, and how early life stress, social determinants of health and structural racism (e.g., discrimination, neighborhood disparities) may “get under the skin” to confer inter-generational risk and resilience for developmental psychopathology and health disparities, especially among children and adolescents from marginalized backgrounds. We use a wide range of research methods to investigate research questions: (1) Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), (2) self-report survey, (3) ecological momentary assessment, and (4) self-report survey. 

## Course Expectations: 
- RAs enrolled in CPSY4994 are expected to attend and contribute to weekly lab meetings, track their hours of lab work in the lab, and complete required canvas assignments
    - Further registration and onboarding information can be found on the lab wiki
- RAs are expected to complete the majority of their lab hours IN PERSON
    - RAs must attend the weekly RA meeting in person
    - RAs are expected to attend and contribute to biweekly DANCE Lab meetings
    - RAs must complete AT LEAST one three-hour block of lab work in-person every week
- RAs are expected to participate in lab data collection, which may occur on weekends or evenings
- RAs assigned to lab workgroups are expected to attend workgroup meetings and contribute to workgroup projects
- RAs are expected to conduct themselves professionally and establish open communication with supervisors in the lab
- RAs are expected to complete lab assignments on time, be prepared for meetings, and respond to emails, slack messages, and other forms of lab communications in a timely manner

## Course Assignments:
- **Online Trainings**: ALL RAs will be required to complete the HIPAA and CITI trainings required by the university for RAs to participate in data collection and curation
- **Journal club discussion questions**: We will be diving into emotion regulation in our biweekly lab meetings. RAs will be expected to read the assigned journal articles and to submit one journal club discussion question per article on canvas

- **Lab Meeting Presentation**: When you are preparing your presentation for lab meeting, make sure to contextualize the articles that you select by presenting where the journal was published and who the authors are. 
- **Research proposal**: RAs will design and propose a research project in a 4-6 page (12 pt font, double-spaced, Times New Roman) research proposal due at the end of the semester
    - Detailed instructions for proposal can be found on lab wiki page
- **Conference-style poster**: RAs will present their research proposal in a conference-style poster at the end of the semester
    - RAs will present their poster at the ICD Undergraduate Poster Symposium
    - Detailed instructions for creating the poster can be found on the lab wiki page
- **Lab hours tracking**: RAs will be required to track the hours they work in the lab on the RA tracking spreadsheet
    -   RAs are responsible for completing a certain number of hours per week in-lab, depending on how many credits they are signed up for
        - 2 credits = 6 hours in lab per week
        - 3 credits = 9 hours in lab per week
        - 4 credits = 12 hours in lab per week
    -  RAs must schedule AT LEAST one 3-hour block of in-person lab work per week, during lab manager hours. This block of time is independent of our weekly lab meetings or RA meetings. These blocks of time are imperative for training and practice
    - **RA hour tracking timesheet can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15qTXUMN8jwQ0ACuLg4mFGr-Zx7q3d-NJHGxlhCeM8_8/edit?gid=0#gid=0)**
- **Lab work**: RAs will complete various pieces of lab work over the course of the semester, both in response to RA meeting practical lessons and as part of lab ongoing study work groups or participant-facing data collection. This work is not a formal assignment, but will make up the bulk of your weekly hours. *Completing lab work in your lab hours makes up the majority of your final grade*.
