# Welcome to the D.A.N.C.E. Lab! We're excited to have you join! 

The Development, Affective Neuroscience, Culture, and Environment Lab aims to study cultural diversity, children and adolescents' mental health, and the developing brain using a bioecological framework. Research in the lab employs diverse methods, including longitudinal study design, cross-cultural and behavioral experiments, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), neuroendocrine assays (cortisol), and neuroimaging tools (fNIRS, EEG/ERP, and fMRI). 

As an undergraduate RA, you will have many opportunities to develop your research skills and acquire a deeper understanding of the scientific method. You may gain experience conducting literature reviews, familiarity with survey design (using Qualtrics and REDCap), interview assessment, mobile EEG and fNIRS experiment setup, subject recruitment, data collection, coding, and curation, and important administrative tasks such as IRB protocol development. 

However, there are a few tasks that must be completed before you are able to begin working in the lab: 

## Enrolling in CPSY4994

You will need to be enrolled for your chosen number of credits in CPSY4994 in order to get course credit for working in the DANCE Lab. 

Submit an online [*Direct Activity* contract](https://wfgen.umn.edu/wfgen/show.aspx?QUERY=START&P=DIRECTED_ACTIVITY&BACKURL_SUBMIT=https://wfgen.umn.edu/WFGen/WfApps/WebForms/ASR-WFGen/directed_activity/v2/thankyou.aspx) and fill out the requested information:

You can enter the following text for project title, description, and methods

> **Project Title: Emotion Regulation Development** 

> *Project Description:*
>Students in the D.A.N.C.E lab will conduct projects or related works focusing on typical and atypical emotion regulation development, cultural factors that shape regulation, and how early life stress, social determinants of health and structural racism (e.g., discrimination, neighborhood disparities) may “get under the skin” to confer intergenerational risk and resilience for developmental psychopathology and health disparities, especially among children and adolescents from marginalized backgrounds.
Method, resources, and strategies to be used: 
(1) literature review, (2) survey design using Qualtrics and REDCap (3) interview assessment, (4) mobile EEG & fNIRS experiment setup, (2) subject recruitment and flyer design, (3) data coding and collection, and (4) other administrative tasks (e.g., IRB) as needed.


Once the contract is approved, you will receive a permission code to register for the course. You can find the course CPSY 4994 on your schedule builder. Make sure to select section 022 listed with Dr. Ka I Ip.
