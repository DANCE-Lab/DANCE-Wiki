# Setting up short distance channel protocol**

*Complete this protocol before you populate the source and detector bundles*

## Materials:
- 1 short distance channel bundles *see photo A*
- Reverse action pliers *see photo B*
- 1 fNIRS cap 
- Short distance channel organizers *see photo D*

## Protocol:
1. Turn fNIRS cap inside out and stretch over the mannequin 
2. By using the reverse action pliers, remove the “spring grommet ring” (see photo C) for all the detector grommets 
3. You may need to turn the cap back and forth to determine which grommets are detectors 
4. Hold the short distance channels by the plastic black piece (not the wires) and slide them over the back side of the grommet 
5. They will side over the part you removed the spring grommet ring from
6. Once all short distance channels are placed in respective grommets organize the wires using the “short distance channel organizers” 
7. Take two of the short distance channel wires and place in the groves of the organizer 
8. Note: the groves side of the organizer will be facing out on the outside of the cap
9. Push the organizer through one mesh hole in the fNIRS cap 
10. Adjust the wires so that they are straight but not pulling *See photo D for proper placement*
11. Turn cap over and begin populating fNIRS cap protocol
