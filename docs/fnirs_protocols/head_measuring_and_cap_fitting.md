# Head Measuring & Cap Fitting Protocol 

### Measurements 
Ask the child if they are feeling comfortable during the procedures as well.

Measure the following with the tape measure in centimeters:

- Nasion (Nz, lowest point in between eyes) to Inion (Iz, the bump) - “mohawk”
- 10% point - 10% of the measurement of point Nz to Iz. Mark the 10% dot above the Nz point with “magic” marker  
- Nz to Cz (forehead to middle of head, 1/2 of Nz-Iz measurement) 
- Left Preauricular Point (LPA) to Right Preauricular Point (RPA)  - “headband”
- Circumference - measure around the participant's head, anchoring the measuring tape at the participant's brow ridge and their inion 
- Record hair color (black, brown, dirty blonde, blond, white) hair type (kinky curls, curly, wavy, straight) and cap size 

(see appendix A)

### Measuring Step-by-Step Guide

Fitting the Cap: Step by Step

Measuring and cap fitting steps must be done in a consistent order.

**1. Measure the distance from the participant's nasion to their inion**. Write the measurement on the fNIRS run sheet.

**2. Calculate the 10% point from your Nz to Iz measurement and mark its location on the participant's forehead with a skin-safe marker**. Write the measurement on the fNIRS run sheet.

**3. Measure and record the RPA-LPA distance**

**4. Using the brow ridge and the inion to anchor your measurement, measure the participant's head circumference**. Write the measurement on the fNIRS run sheet.

**5. Choose the correct cap size for your participant, based on their head circumference and ethnicity**

**6. Place your hands inside the cap and gently pull it onto your participant's head**. Make sure the front of the cap is lined up with the 10% mark on their forehead

**7. Check the location of the vertex (CZ)** by making sure it lies at the intersection of Nz-Iz and RPA-LPA measurements

### Record the measures on the [Head Measuring Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UcDkLP-O8VpKGiGA65uevUrkC7pCiOW2Ft8FOpXt7EA/edit?tab=t.0) and find the best-fitting cap for the participant. 

| Circumference (cm) | Cap Size |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 49.0-50.9 | Size 50 | 
| 51.0-52.9 | Size 52 |
| 53.0-54.9 | Size 54 |
| 55.0-56.9 | Size 56 |
| 57.0-58.9 | Size 58 |
| 59.0-60.9 | Size 60 |

When placing the cap on the participant's head, if there are bumps or raised areas, size down a cap size.

### Placing the cap 
Choose the **Caucasian cap** (for all races besides Asian) and **Asian cap** (for Asian participants)
Stand behind the participants. 
Ask the participant to tuck their hair behind their ears (if applicable)
Place both hands inside the cap and hold the cap up, slowly and carefully place the cap on the participant's head (if available use two RAs for this step)
Adjust by pulling the cap to fit the participant’s head. 
Be aware of the participant's earrings and piercings whenever placing or taking off the cap. 


### Ensuring correct placement 

Measure the Nz to point Cz (forehead to center of head) 
Measures the Iz to point Cz (bump on back of head to center of head)  
Both measurements should be equal.  If not, adjust the cap accordingly
Measure RPA to Cz (right ear to middle of head) 
Measure Cz to LPA (middle of head to left ear).
Both measurements should be equal.  If not, adjust the cap accordingly
Measure the 10% point to make sure that the cap is pulled down far enough 
The 10% point should fall on the “x” marking on the cap

**If the cap is already populated, move to the next step in the protocol.  If the cap is not populated, remove cap and populate before placing back on the participant’s head.**

# Additional Background and Vocabulary Guide

1. **The nasion**: this is the point just above the bridge of the nose where the frontal and nasal bones meet. It is easily identified as the deepest part of the indentation between the brow ridge and the nose

2. **The inion**: this is the projecting part of the occipital bone, towards the base of the skull. It typically falls around an inch below the widest point of the skull and can be identified as a small bump on the back of the head when felt with two fingers

3. **The vertex**: the vertex is the top of the skull (also called "CZ", the location of the central midline electrode in EEG) and falls midway between the nasion and the inion

4. **The 10% point**: this point is exactly 10% the distance between the nasion and the inion above the nasion; that is, if the distance between the nasion and the inion measures 38 cm, the 10% point would fall 3.8 cm above the nasion

5. **The preauricular point**: this point lies in front of the upper end of the tragus (ear) and is the landmark used to determine the midline of the head. A measurement from left preauricular point to right preauricular point allows the technician to properly determine the location of the vertex

You will reference all of these landmarks when conducting measurements at the beginning of fNIRS data collection. The accuracy of our data also relies on the accuracy of our documentation, so you will need to record every measurement you take as you take it on the DANCE lab fNIRS run sheet Download fNIRS run sheet. 

**Run Sheet Measurements**: 

Metric: we only use centimeters for our scientific measurements! Under no circumstances should measurments ever be taken in inches.

1. *Nz to Iz (Mohawk)*: Nz is shorthand for "nasion". Iz is shorthand for "inion". "Mohawk" is a little reminder that this measurement follows the midline of the skull, like a mohawk hairdo. You capture this measurement by locating the nasion, locating the inion, and measuring directly from nasion (at 0cm) to the inion. This measurement is very important to get right, as it also determines two other measurements and guides cap fitting. Write the measurement value on the run sheet once you have collected it. 

2. *Nz to CZ (Nasion to middle of head)*: This measurement captures the distance between the nasion and the vertex. This measurement is exactly one half of the distance between the nasion and the inion (measurement Nz to Iz). Write the measurement value on the run sheet once you have calculated it.

3. *RPA to LPA (Headband)*: RPA is shorthand for "right preauricular point". LPA is shorthand for "left preauricular point". "Headband" is a little reminder that this midline is taken from ear to ear, like a headband would sit on the head. You capture this measurement by locating the RPA (0cm) and measuring across the very top of the head (vertex; halfway between Nz and Iz) to the LPA. This measurement will be used to make sure that the cap is fitting correctly on the participant's head. Write the measurement value on the run sheet once you have collected it. 

4. *10% Point*: The 10% point is exactly 10% of the distance between the nasion and the inion. You can calculate the distance from the nasion to the 10% point by calculating 10% of the Nz to Iz measurement (this can be easily done by moving the decimal point: if your measurement from Nz to Iz is 38.0 cm, move the decimal point one digit to the left to calculate the 10% point: 3.8 cm). On this participant, you would locate the nasion (0 cm) and measure 3.8 cm up, marking the point with a short line on the forehead with a skin-safe marker. This measurement gives you a starting point when fitting the cap. Write the measurement value on the run sheet once you have calculated it.

5. *Circumference*: The circumference is the distance around the participant's head, anchored at the brow ridge and the inion. These landmarks help us measure how large the participant's head is at its widest point. This measurement is very important, because it will determine the cap size used for the participant. Take the measurement by placing the end of the measuring tape (0 cm) at the participant's 10% point and by identifying the inion on the back of the head. Once you have found the inion, place your index and middle fingers together just above the inion, and draw the measuring tape around the head, laying the tape in the space just above your second finger. Write the measurement value on the run sheet once you have collected it. 

 

Choosing the Correct Cap Size

The participant's head circumference and their ethnicity will determine the correct cap type and size to select for data collection. NIRx makes 2 types of caps: one type intended for individuals whose ethnicity is Asian, and one type that can be used for all other ethnicities. Cap types are labeled and color coded (Asian caps have blue labels). Caps are generally sized two cm apart (e.g., 52cm, 54cm, 56cm). If your participant falls in-between sizes, choose the cap closest to the participant's head size, rounding up for participants who fall directly in the middle (e.g., if your participant's head is 52.7 cm, choose a 52cm cap. If your participant's head is 53cm, you would choose the 54cm cap).
