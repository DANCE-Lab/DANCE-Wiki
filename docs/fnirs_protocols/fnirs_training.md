# fNIRS Training

The DANCE Lab hosts a training bootcamp that covers all major components of fNIRS data collection: head measuring, cap population, connecting to fNIRS device and computers, and collecting data for both using the following softwares: Hyperscan, Aurora, and E-Prime. Videos from our most recent bootcamp are linked on youtube and can be found below. Additional details and training information can be accessed through the [DANCE Lab fNRIS Training Canvas Course](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/399112).

## fNIRS Capping 

This initial video covers the most important part of fNIRS data collection (hint: head measuring and documentation!) and goes through all of the hardware needed to assemble an fNIRS cap for data collection.

## Connecting to Computers and Using Aurora, E-Prime, and Hyperscan

This video covers how to connect your fNIRS cap to an fNIRS device, how to connect to the software programs we use to run tasks and collect data (Hyperscan, E-Prime, Aurora), and how to complete phantom testing.
