# fNIRS Standard Operating Practices and Study Procedures

The following pages contain instructions and protocols for setting up fNIRS caps and conducting fNIRS data collection. You can find step-by-step instructions for data collection and curation as well as equipment cleaning protocols.

Welcome to the first fNIRS training module! This canvas course has been designed to familiarize you with the neuroimaging modality fNIRS, or functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy, and the DANCE Lab protocols we use in data collection.

## Introduction to DANCE Lab fNIRS

The DANCE Lab has a number of step-by-step protocols that will guide you through the data collection procedure. These SOPs are kept 1.) Printed, in a white binder in the DANCE Lab control room; 2.) in the [DANCE Lab google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bJeYDBXjKn9TenocR24nVK_wIFZWcl4K?ths=true); and, most accessibly, 3.) in these wiki pages! Any questions you have about data collection can generally be answered by these documents. 


Before you begin fNIRS training, there are a few steps you should take to make sure you have appropriate access to DANCE resources and lab spaces. 

1. Ensure that you have been added to the DANCE slack and google drive (email the lab manager if you are having difficulty accessing any necessary documents) 

2. Ensure that you have key card access to Campbell hall and room 200 (DANCE lab) and room 205 (sink room, for cleaning supplies). If you do not have access yet, you can get access by filling out this [google form](https://z.umn.edu/ICDaccess). 

3. Ensure that you have completed the required [HIPAA and CITI trainings](https://dance-lab.github.io/DANCE-Management/docs/undergrad_ras/onboarding/) necessary to work with participants and access data


Once you complete this course and pass a practical examination, you will be able to collect fNIRS data independently! RAs working with participants on studies will also need to be trained in obtaining informed consent and administering cognitive tasks. These modules will guide you through the at-home portion of fNIRS training. The second half of the training will take place in person at the DANCE Lab, where you will get hands-on experience working with the fNIRS equipment (these practical sessions will be recorded and posted to canvas). You are also expected to make time to come into the lab and practice each step of the data collection protocol, from head measuring to cap cleaning, in addition to the practical sessions. Once you have completed training you will schedule a 30-minute block to be evaluated on your fNIRS administration. You will be graded based on [this rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pkP81NdA28miadirNdQlSYtA4JvxsitJlXVzzJpVgFM/edit?usp=sharing).
